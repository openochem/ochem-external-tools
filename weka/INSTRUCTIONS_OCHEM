The weka jar should be downloaded from http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html

This file should be inside of the folder and renamed as weka.jar.

OCHEM supports only version 3.6.15 of Weka. 

The later versions will not work due to the change of the binary format of Weka.

The code (files are copied to /etc/source/weka during installation)

# WEKA
cd
mkdir -p /etc/source/weka
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/files/weka-3-6/3.6.15/weka-3-6-15.zip/download
unzip download
weka-3-6-15/weka.jar /etc/source/weka
rm download
